# **Other Services**

I offer a wide variety of services related to planning, managing and executing digital projects. Here are a few of the highlights:

## **PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

As a formally trained PMP and a boots-on-the-ground project manager for the past 15+ years, I understand where the balances need to be struck. I am familiar with the formal methodologies (e.g. 'Waterfall' and 'Agile') but understand that when the rubber meets the road, every project is a series of compromises.

I find that the two most valuable tools in my kit for project management include:

1. Communication
2. Organization

**Communicating **effectively is a delicate skill that one hones through many years of experience, and by being exposed to many different personalities and projects. It's definitely not a one-size-fits-all skill. A skillful project manager knows how to read the room, and efficiently communicate with all different personality types. Not being intimidated or snapping to quick judgements is key.

Being **organized **is the hallmark of an excellent project manager. There are myriad different tools that one can use to facilitate all the tasks, budgets, emails and time entries that take place, but poor organizational skills will always seep their way in. I pride myself on being extremely detail oriented. I keep detailed notes for all important interactions, always have a to-do list at the ready, and heavily lean on scheduling and collaboration tools. It's impossible to hold all the details of all your projects in your head, so great organization is paramount. I want to ensure that anyone can see where things are at without my having to be involved.

## **BUSINESS ANALYSIS/PROJECT PLANNING**

This is akin to creating the blueprints for a building before digging the foundation. Knowing whether you're building a bungalow or a skyscraper will dramatically impact the size of hole you dig.

As with project management, the process for uncovering a project's blueprints tends to vary from project to project. I do, however, find myself consistently using the following tools:

* Requirements gathering sessions/meetings/surveys
* User Personas and Use Cases
* Wireframing and behavioural notes

Requirements gathering usually takes one or more of a few different forms:

* Workshops/meetings/planning sessions
* Surveys

It's a very iterative process. It requires prodding and patience, and revisiting and vetting the ideas. And you must realize that any 'consensus' you get is likely to evolve throughout the life of the project.

Utilizing User Personas and Use Cases is an age old practice that is still very effective. It's centered around the notion of User Experience; who will be using the final deliverables from the project, and what sort of activities will they use it for?

Creating wireframes is a very useful way to give stakeholders an opportunity to see their ideas in a visual format. It really helps with visualization, and leads to much more clarity. Adding on behavioural notes takes it one step further by identifying assumptions, validations, and additional processes.

## **PROCESS IMPROVEMENT**

I have worked with about half a dozen organizations over the past 15 years. For 10 of those years, I ran my own website development agency. During that time I made of various different processes to get the work done. I've had experience with dozens of different systems, and I've identified strengths and weaknesses for each. I've found some sweet spots along the way, and I've been able to bring those to different organizations, and help them evolve to best suit their existing business practices.
