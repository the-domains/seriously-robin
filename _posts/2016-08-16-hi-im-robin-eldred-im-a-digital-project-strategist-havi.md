# This is me

Hi. I'm Robin Eldred. I'm a digital project strategist, having worked in the world of the web since the mid 1990s.

I consult on a freelance basis. I help organizations get digital projects done. This can involve planning and requirements gathering, business analysis, project management, or general consultation/advice. Often times, all of the above.

I help small teams accomplish things like:

* Website builds and redevelopments
* Software development
* Mobile application development
* Process improvement

If you'd like to chat about how I can help your digital project get done, and done right, [contact me][0].
