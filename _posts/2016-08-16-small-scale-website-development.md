# **SMALL-SCALE WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT**

I leverage the power of Squarespace to build simple, content-management-driven, well thought out and SEO-friendly websites for small businesses.

In today's day and age you shouldn't have to spend a fortune to get a good, feature-rich website. What you_should _be spending your money on is the truly important stuff:

1. **Strategy. **Know the purpose of your website, what it's intended to do, for whom, and how that will be accomplished.
2. **Content. **The right messaging is critical to achieving your strategy. This includes the words, photos, graphics, SEO and more.

The commoditized parts of website development should be left to the automated tools. These are things like a CMS, a responsive template, and a well designed layout. Don't reinvent the wheel here. It's expensive, time-consuming and often times not as good as what's readily available.

I've been planning, building, managing and deploying websites for nearly 20 years. As part of my consulting practice, I bring this extensive experience and some heavy duty website skills to small businesses.

### **THE PRICE**

Most projects can be done for under $1,000\. Here's a full list of what I'll do:

* Purchase domain name and setup a handful of email addresses for you (if required)
* Setup Squarespace account and link domain name
* Create a simple online strategy unique to your business
* Create your initial site map (information architecture)
* Help you select a template and imagery
* Perform some SEO research
* Write your initial content and ensure it's SEO-friendly
* Publish your new website
* Show you how to manage your website going forward
* Hand over all the keys to you

Bonus: If you offer a product or service that I have a personal interest in, we might be able to do a trade.

### **GETTING STARTED**

Sound interesting? [Contact me][0] and let's discuss next steps.

**Please Note: **This is a side business for me. I work on it after hours and on the weekends. Doesn't affect the quality one bit, but it might mean we're exchanging emails and having phone calls off-hours.
